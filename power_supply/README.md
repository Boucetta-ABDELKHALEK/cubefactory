### photovoltaic generator

The PV generator converts sunlight directly into electrical direct current and allows to operate the printer or charge the battery storage system. The PV generator itself consists of 3 foldable modules, which makes it possible to fit the modules, like all other components, into the case. In this way, the modules can be easily transported and, if necessary, protected against environmental influences.

### Battery storage system

In order to store the surplus energy generated by pv-generator, and compensate for irregularities in the power generation, the Cube Factory 2 has a lithium battery.

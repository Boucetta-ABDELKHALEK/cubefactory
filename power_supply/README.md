### photovoltaic generator

The PV generator converts sunlight directly into electrical direct current and allows to operate the printer or charge the battery storage system. The PV generator itself consists of 3 foldable modules, which makes it possible to fit the modules, like all other components, into the case. In this way, the modules can be easily transported and, if necessary, protected against environmental influences.

### Battery storage system

In order to store the surplus energy generated by pv-generator, and compensate for irregularities in the power generation, the Cube Factory 2 has a lithium battery.

#### discharge curve

The discharge curve describes the relationship between remaining capacity and operating voltage. The characteristic feature of lithium batteries is that they supply a constant voltage over the entire discharge period. The following figure shows the charging curve for a lithium battery for different C values.

The mentioned C-value indicates the factor of the battery charge quantity that is discharged per hour

#### Calculation of the required charge quantity

The Cube Factory's battery is designed to operate the 3D printer for about *t=8* hours. In order to determine the required charge quantity *Q* the power consumption *P* and the electricity consumption *i* of the 3D printer must be known. In the case of our printer *P = 100 W* and *I = 10 A* applies. Furthermore, a battery can only be discharged to a certain degree, since otherwise the electrodes will be damaged. For lithium systems, this maximum degree of discharge *e* is at about 90%. 
With these values, the required charge quantity can be calculated and the following applies: Q = 1/e* t* i = 1/0.9* 8* 10 = 88.89 Ah. With an existing capacity of 100 Ah the requirement is fulfilled.

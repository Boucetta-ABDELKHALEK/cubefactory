### Photovoltaic generator

The PV generator converts sunlight directly into electrical direct current and allows to operate the printer or charge the battery storage system. The PV generator itself consists of 3 foldable modules, which makes it possible to fit the modules, like all other components, into the case. In this way, the modules can be easily transported and, if necessary, protected against environmental influences.

### Battery storage system

In order to store the surplus energy generated by  PV generator, and compensate for irregularities in the power generation, the CubeFactory 2 has a lithium battery.

#### Discharge curve

The discharge curve describes the relationship between remaining capacity and operating voltage. The characteristic feature of lithium batteries is that they supply a constant voltage over the entire discharge period. The following figure shows the charging curve for a lithium battery for different C values.

The mentioned C-value indicates the factor of the battery charge quantity that is discharged per hour.

#### Calculation of the required charge quantity

The CubeFactory's battery is designed to operate the 3D printer for about *t=8* hours. In order to determine the required charge quantity *Q* the power consumption *P* and the electricity consumption *i* of the 3D printer must be known. In the case of our printer *P = 100 W* and *I = 10 A* applies. Furthermore, a battery can only be discharged to a certain degree, since otherwise the electrodes will be damaged. For lithium systems, this maximum degree of discharge *e* is at about 90%. 
With these values, the required charge quantity can be calculated and the following applies:

With an existing capacity of 100 Ah the requirement is fulfilled.

### Equipment

####  Charge controller and MPPT

The MPPT charge controller fulfills several important functions, which are briefly explained below. On the one hand, it ensures that the battery (12.8V charging voltage) can be charged via the photovoltaic system (14V nominal voltage). Generally speaking, it is possible with the charge controller to charge a battery with a lower nominal voltage via a photovoltaic system with a higher nominal voltage. 

In its function as charge controller, the device ensures that charging method and charging current are selected so that the longest possible battery life is achieved. Furthermore, the control unit provides an over and deep discharge protection to prevent damage to the battery.

The last function is the function as Maximum Power Tracker (MPPT). Here, the optimum operating point is determined continuously, in which the output power is maximized.

####   MPPT control



In order to configure and evaluate the MPPT charger, an MPPT controller is used. This is a solar computer or a remote-control panel which allows to monitor the following performance parameters in real time.
*	Power of the solar module
*	Voltage of the solar module
*	Daily income in kWh
*	Display of current charging stage
*	Charging and discharging current of the battery
*	Battery voltage

In addition, it is possible to retrieve historical data from the last 30 days.

#### AC charger
In order to be able to charge the battery by alternating current via the mains, the CubeFactory 2 also has a mains charger which is designed for 100 to 240 V AC.

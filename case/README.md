# Case

![Case|1](https://image.ibb.co/jKBLKa/GCSM_Pr_si_08.jpg)

In order to protect the components of the CubeFactory 2 during transportation and  from extreme environmental influences, the components are placed in a case. The case therefore represents the system boundary of the CubeFactory 2. 
A mandatory requirement of the CubeFactory 2 is the possibility of transportation by one person. The fulfillment  of this requirement had to be realized by selecting a suitable case. For this purpose, the chosen model has rollers and a pull-out handle.

### Important parameters

The following table provides an overview of the most important parameters.

| Parameter | Value |Unit|
| :----  | :------ |:------:|
| Inner dimensions | 737 x 356 x 457 | mm |
| Outer dimensions | 801 x 399 x 522 | mm |
| Weight | 11.3 | kg |
| Protection class | IP67 |-|
| Price | 250 | EUR |

#### Degree of protection 

In the original state, the case has protection class IP67. By screwing the components in the case, this protection is lost, but the case is still protected to IP65.
The degree of protection describes the suitability of a device for various environmental conditions, more precisely the protection against direct contact or penetration of solids and liquids. For our case only the last two are relevant.
The degree of protection 65 covers the protection against dust (dustproof) and the protection against water jets.

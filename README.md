## About

The CubeFactory 2 is a self sustaining mini factory to apply sustainable value creation in areas with insufficient infrastructure. It was developed at the Department for Assembly Technology and Factory Management of the Technische Universit√§t Berlin.

Especially in Emerging Countries there is a high demand for self-driven value creation. This is caused by an insufficient infrastructure of energy, technology and raw material. Also industrial and humanitarian supply chains are slow, difficult and expensive and equipment for value creation can be expensive and demands skills.
The motivation is that communities affected by a low standard of living or disaster are able to control their situation by manufacturing essential life-saving and life-sustaining supplies by their own.

In general, the CubeFactory 2 has the following purposes:
* mediation of a sustain value creation
* production of 3D printed objects by operating with disposable resources to create a sustain product
* realization of closed loop material cycles
* low-cost manufacturing of material and product
* enabling small producers to access markets

## Contribute

Our aim is to motivate you to improve, modify and alternate the way the CubeFactory works. 
There is a high flexibility in terms of selecting the particular components for the CubeFactory 2. For example, the energy could alternatively be sourced from a car battery or generated through wind or water power. While the 3D-printer is an independent open source project, the Recycler was developed at our department for the use in the CubeFactory and offers a lot of room for improvement.
Your ideas are welcome.

## 1.About

The CubeFactory 2 is a self sustaining mini factory to apply sustainable value creation in areas with insufficient infrastructure. It was developed at the Apartment Assembly Technoligy and Factory Management of the Technische Universität Berlin.

Especially in Emerging Countries there is a high demand for self-driven value creation. This is caused by an insufficient infrastructure of energy, technology and raw material. Also industrial and humanitarian supply chains are slow, difficult and expensive and equipment for value creation can be expensive and demands skills.
The motivation is that communities affected by a low standard of living or disaster are able to control their situation by manufacturing essential life-saving and life-sustaining supplies by their own.

In general, the CubeFactory 2 has the following purposes:
•	mediation of a sustain value creation
•	production of 3D printed objects by operating with disposable resources to create a sustain product
•	realization of closed loop material cycles
•	low-cost manufacturing of material and product
•	enabling small producers to access markets

## 2. Components

The CubeFactory 2 contains all necessary infrastructure for production. It consists of the following components:
•	Case
•	PET Shredder and Extruder
•	Foldable Solar Panels
•	Accumulator
•	3D FDM Printer

There is a high flexibility in terms of selecting the particular components for the CubeFactory 2. We are open for any improvements or sugesstions.
The energy supply can e.g. alternatively be realized by using portable wind power- or water power generators.

## How To

__For an online overview:__ browse the CAD(stl)-folder, where you can see 3d-views of every part and the corresponding exploded views

__Or download:__ 

+ the CAD(step) folder (same structure as STL folder but without exploded views)

+ the CAD(solidworks) folder (particular structure, no information loss)  

__Open/Manipulate the files:__ We used the open-source 3D modeler _[FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/)_ to work with the STEP- and STL-files. If you have access to the commercial Software _[Solidworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SolidWorks)_, you should use the corresponding files to avoid information loss.

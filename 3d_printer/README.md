For the CubeFactory2 project an open source printer from RepRap was used. The decision for selecting this printer was made by the decisive facts of the dimensions and the price.

The Hephestos is a further development of the Prusa i3 by Rep-Rap. It offers significant improvements and consists of a DIY (do it yourself) assembly set that is easier and more intuitive. Hephestos offers to create designs, prototypes, figures, accessories, models, etc.
This model is characterized by its easy and convenient assembly. As a result, the individual steps were substantially simplified and the instructions were made more visual. The Hephestos is based 100% on free hardware and can be changed and further developed.
